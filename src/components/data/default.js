  body: `My name is Arron Kukadia. Thank you for your interest in me as your photographer. I specialise in outdoor portrait photoshoots, typically in London. I adapt my style of photography to capture specific moods and emotions, always looking for the perfect composition.

  Over 10 years ago, when I was on holiday in Spain, I was using an old compact camera, handed down to me from my dad, taking pictures of anything that caught my eye - from the beautiful landscapes to the actors dressed in costume at a theme park. I have always been someone that has a creative mind and the camera helped me to capture this. This is where my journey as a photographer began.
  
  I was gifted a DSLR camera for my 20th birthday. I began experimenting with portrait photography and developing my brand: AK1photography. Portrait shooting exposed me to a whole new side of photography, allowing me to create eye catching, memorable and mesmerising compositions. Since starting my journey with portrait photography, I have not looked back. 
    
  Photography is my passion and if you feel my style of photography is for you, please feel free to view my portfolio or book a shoot. I always go above and beyond to ensure my clients are satisfied. `,

    body: 'My name is Kate. I used to work with a model agency, before I realized that I want to collaborate with photographers directly and realize some of the ideas I had on my mind, to work in team with photographer and to take equal part in the shooting process. I worked as a freelance model for one year in Russia and then started to travel just to meet new people,to discover the attitude to photography and to see how this field looks like in different places of the world. On my way I was lucky to meet Arron in London. I accidentally came across his page and really liked the style of his works. Then just texted him and suggested collaboration. We discussed the idea of the shooting, the details and location. I am always surprised when I meet such enthusiastic people. Itâ€™s a great pleasure to work wIth someone who is as passionate about the photography as I am! With people like that time usually flies during the shooting. And in this case it was exactly like that! Even though we had to do a long way to the chosen location and after even longer way to the second location, I didnâ€™t notice how the time passed by. Thatâ€™s what I really appreciate! And of course, after Iâ€™ve got photos which I absolutely love!',

    body: `Three words to sum up working with this photographer:

    Focused, friendly, and Imaginative.

    Prior to the shoot, he had done his due diligence. We had decided to shoot in Canary Wharf, and from the jump, he knew where was best for particular styled pictures.

    He had a keen eye for attention to detail - which locations had the best lighting, or matched the effect of the mood and expressions I was trying to create. In that sense, he is a visionary.

    But above all, he was a really fun person to work with. The time of the shoot flew by: he knew what he was doing, and kept the proceedings fun and engaging at all times.

    I would highly recommend him to anyone out there!`,
